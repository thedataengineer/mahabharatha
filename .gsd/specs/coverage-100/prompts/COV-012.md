# COV-012: Test level state and event tracking

## Overview
Create tests for level status transitions, event filtering, history truncation in tests/unit/test_state_levels.py.

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/test_state_levels.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `zerg/state.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_state_levels.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test set_level_status transitions
- [ ] Test get_events with type filter
- [ ] Test get_events with time range filter
- [ ] Test event history truncation (max events)
- [ ] Test level completion timestamp tracking
