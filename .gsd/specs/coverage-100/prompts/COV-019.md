# COV-019: Integration test for complete merge flow

## Overview
Create integration test for full merge workflow from prepare to finalize with mocked Git operations in tests/integration/test_merge_integration.py.

## Files to Create
- `tests/integration/test_merge_integration.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `zerg/merge.py`
- `tests/mocks/mock_merge.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_merge_integration.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test full merge flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test merge with gate pass/fail integration
- [ ] Test merge conflict handling in full flow
- [ ] Test staging branch creation and cleanup
- [ ] Test merge result propagation to caller
