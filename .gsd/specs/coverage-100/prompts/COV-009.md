# COV-009: Test StateManager load/save edge cases

## Overview
Create tests for load with missing/corrupt files, save with write errors in tests/unit/test_state_persistence.py.

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/test_state_persistence.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `zerg/state.py`
- `tests/mocks/mock_state.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_state_persistence.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test load with missing state file (creates new)
- [ ] Test load with corrupt JSON file
- [ ] Test save with write permission error
- [ ] Test save creates backup before overwrite
- [ ] Test atomic save prevents partial writes
