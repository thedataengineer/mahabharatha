# COV-004: Test MergeFlowResult dataclass methods

## Overview
Add comprehensive tests for MergeFlowResult.to_dict() in tests/unit/test_merge_flow.py covering all fields including gate_results serialization, timestamp formatting, and None handling.

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/test_merge_flow.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `zerg/merge.py`
- `tests/mocks/mock_merge.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_merge_flow.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test MergeFlowResult initialization with all fields
- [ ] Test to_dict() serializes all fields correctly
- [ ] Test gate_results list serialization
- [ ] Test timestamp ISO format conversion
- [ ] Test with None values for optional fields
