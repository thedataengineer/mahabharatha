# Brainstorm Transcript: MAHABHARATHA Website

## Q1: Site approach
**A**: Replace MkDocs entirely — one unified custom site with Mahabharatha theme, built with HTML/CSS/JS.

## Q2: Primary goal
**A**: All of the above — developer adoption first, but also community building + portfolio showcase.

## Q3: Theme depth
**A**: Subtle nods only — dark theme with purple accents, Mahabharatha logo, occasional references. Reads as a serious dev tool.

## Q4: Essential sections
**A**: Hero + Quick Start + Features. Docs should point to GitHub wiki, not duplicated on site.

## Q5: Tech stack
**A**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS — zero build step, Tailwind via CDN, deploys as-is to GitHub Pages.

## Q6: Visual elements (combining both reference sites)
**A**: Best of everything — dark theme, glassmorphism cards, top nav bar, deep scroll, animated code blocks, stat counters, FAQ accordion, copy-to-clipboard.

## Q7: Hero section
**A**: Combined approach — commanding statement headline ("The only Claude Code orchestrator that auto-secures, containerizes, and parallelizes your entire feature.") + three glass pillar cards below (Security | Containers | Parallelism) + pip install CTA.

## Q8: Docs strategy
**A**: Commands cheat sheet on-site (quick reference table of all /mahabharatha: commands with one-liners) + link out to GitHub wiki for deep docs.
