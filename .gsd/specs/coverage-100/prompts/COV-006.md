# COV-006: Test run_pre_merge_gates and gate execution

## Overview
Create tests for gate execution with pass/fail scenarios, summary generation in tests/unit/test_merge_gates.py.

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/test_merge_gates.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `zerg/merge.py`
- `zerg/gates.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_merge_gates.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test run_pre_merge_gates with all gates passing
- [ ] Test run_pre_merge_gates with some gates failing
- [ ] Test run_pre_merge_gates with required_only=True
- [ ] Test gate summary logging
- [ ] Test with custom working directory
