## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_merge_full_flow.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test full_merge_flow success path
- [ ] Test full_merge_flow with gate failures
- [ ] Test full_merge_flow with merge conflicts
- [ ] Test finalize_merge pushes to target branch
- [ ] Test MergeFlowResult returned with correct values
