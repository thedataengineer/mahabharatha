## Core Workflow

---

### /zerg:init

Initialize ZERG for a project. Operates in two modes depending on directory state.

**When to use**: At the start of any project, before any other ZERG commands.

#### Modes

| Mode | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Inception** | Empty directory | Interactive wizard: requirements, tech selection, project scaffolding, git init |
| **Discovery** | Existing code | Auto-detect languages/frameworks, generate `.zerg/` and `.devcontainer/` configs |

#### Usage

```bash
# Empty directory → Inception Mode wizard
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
zerg init

# Existing project → Discovery Mode
cd my-existing-project
zerg init

# With options
zerg init --workers 3 --security strict
zerg init --no-security-rules
zerg init --with-containers
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--workers N` | Set default worker count |
| `--security strict` | Enable strict security rules |
| `--no-security-rules` | Skip fetching security rules from TikiTribe |
| `--with-containers` | Build devcontainer image after init |

#### What Gets Created

| File/Directory | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `.zerg/config.yaml` | ZERG configuration |
| `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` | Container configuration |
| `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` | Worker container image |
| `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` | Post-create setup script |
| `.devcontainer/post-start.sh` | Post-start setup script |
| `.devcontainer/mcp-servers/` | MCP server configuration |
| `.gsd/PROJECT.md` | Project overview |
| `.gsd/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` | Infrastructure requirements |
| `.claude/rules/security/` | Stack-specific security rules (auto-loaded by Claude Code) |
| `CLAUDE.md` (updated) | Security rules summary |

#### Multi-Language Detection

ZERG automatically detects all languages in your project:

| Language | Detection | Default Framework |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py` | FastAPI / Typer |
| TypeScript | `package.json` with TS deps | Fastify / Commander |
| Go | `go.mod` | Gin / Cobra |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` | Axum / Clap |
| Java | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` | — |
| Ruby | `Gemfile` | — |
| C#/.NET | `*.csproj` | — |

#### Security Rules Integration

ZERG automatically fetches stack-specific security rules from [TikiTribe/claude-secure-coding-rules](https://github.com/TikiTribe/claude-secure-coding-rules) and stores them in `.claude/rules/security/`. Claude Code auto-loads all files under `.claude/rules/`, so no `@-imports` are needed. An informational summary is added to `CLAUDE.md`.

---

### /zerg:plan

Capture complete requirements for a feature through interactive questioning.

**When to use**: When starting a new feature. This is always the first step before `/zerg:design`.

#### Usage

```bash
# Plan a feature (interactive mode)
/zerg:plan user-authentication

# Use Socratic discovery mode (structured 3-round questioning)
/zerg:plan user-authentication --socratic

# More rounds of questioning
/zerg:plan user-authentication --socratic --rounds 5
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--socratic` | `-s` | Structured 3-round discovery mode |
| `--rounds N` | — | Number of Socratic rounds (default: 3, max: 5) |

#### Socratic Mode

When `--socratic` is used, the plan follows three structured rounds:

1. **Round 1: Problem Space** — What problem? Who are the users? Why now?
2. **Round 2: Solution Space** — What's the ideal? What constraints? What's out of scope?
3. **Round 3: Implementation Space** — MVP version? Technical risks? How to verify?

Each round asks up to 5 questions and waits for responses before proceeding.

#### What Gets Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.gsd/specs/{feature}/requirements.md` | Structured requirements document |
| `.gsd/.current-feature` | Active feature marker |

#### Status Markers

The requirements document has a status field:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `DRAFT` | Still gathering requirements |
| `REVIEW` | Requirements complete, awaiting approval |
| `APPROVED` | Ready for `/zerg:design` |
| `REJECTED` | Needs revision |

#### Completion

After generating requirements, ZERG presents them for review. Reply with:
- **"APPROVED"** — Proceed to design phase
- **"REJECTED"** — Describe what needs to change

---

### /zerg:design

Generate technical architecture and task graph for parallel execution.

**When to use**: After requirements are approved via `/zerg:plan`. This generates the blueprint that `/zerg:rush` executes.

**Prerequisite**: `.gsd/specs/{feature}/requirements.md` must exist with status APPROVED.

#### What It Does

1. **Architecture Design** — Component analysis, data flow, interface design, key decisions
2. **Implementation Plan** — Break work into phases that enable parallel execution
3. **Task Graph Generation** — Atomic tasks with exclusive file ownership and verification commands
4. **Claude Task Registration** — Creates tracking tasks in the Claude Code Task system
5. **Validation** — Checks for circular dependencies, file ownership conflicts
6. **User Approval** — Presents design for review

#### What Gets Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.gsd/specs/{feature}/design.md` | Technical architecture document |
| `.gsd/specs/{feature}/task-graph.json` | Task definitions in v2.0 schema |

#### Task Graph Schema (v2.0)

Each task in the graph includes:

```json
{
  "id": "FEATURE-L1-001",
  "title": "Create user types",
  "description": "Define TypeScript interfaces for user domain",
  "phase": "foundation",
  "level": 1,
  "dependencies": [],
  "files": {
    "create": ["src/types/user.ts"],
    "modify": [],
    "read": ["src/types/common.ts"]
  },
  "acceptance_criteria": ["Types compile without errors"],
  "verification": {
    "command": "npx tsc --noEmit src/types/user.ts",
    "timeout_seconds": 60
  }
}
```

#### Level Structure

| Level | Name | Characteristics |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Foundation | No dependencies — types, schemas, config |
| 2 | Core | Depends on L1 — business logic, services |
| 3 | Integration | Depends on L2 — APIs, routes, handlers |
| 4 | Testing | Depends on L3 — unit and integration tests |
| 5 | Quality | Depends on L4 — docs, cleanup, polish |

#### File Ownership Rules

1. **Exclusive Create**: Each file created by exactly ONE task
2. **Exclusive Modify**: Each file modified by ONE task per level
3. **Read is Shared**: Multiple tasks can read the same file
4. **Level Boundaries**: A file modified in level N cannot be modified again until level N+1

---

### /zerg:rush

Launch parallel zerglings to execute the task graph.

**When to use**: After architecture is approved via `/zerg:design`. This is the main execution command.

**Prerequisite**: `.gsd/specs/{feature}/task-graph.json` must exist.

#### Usage

```bash
# Launch with default settings (5 workers, auto mode)
/zerg:rush

# Specify worker count
/zerg:rush --workers=3

# Choose execution mode
/zerg:rush --mode container
/zerg:rush --mode subprocess
/zerg:rush --mode task

# Resume interrupted execution
/zerg:rush --resume

# Preview execution plan
/zerg:rush --dry-run

# Start from specific level
/zerg:rush --resume --level 3

# Set timeout
/zerg:rush --timeout 7200
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Short | Description | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--workers N` | `-w` | Number of parallel workers | 5 |
| `--feature TEXT` | `-f` | Feature name (auto-detected) | Current feature |
| `--level N` | `-l` | Start from specific level | 1 |
| `--task-graph PATH` | `-g` | Path to task-graph.json | Auto-detected |
| `--mode TEXT` | `-m` | Execution mode: `subprocess`, `container`, `task`, `auto` | `auto` |
| `--dry-run` | — | Show execution plan without starting | — |
| `--resume` | — | Continue from previous run | — |
| `--timeout N` | — | Max execution time in seconds | 3600 |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose output | — |

#### Execution Modes

| Mode | How Workers Run | Isolation | Requirements |
|------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| `subprocess` | Local Python subprocesses | Git worktrees | Python 3.12+ |
| `container` | Docker containers with worktrees | Full container isolation | Docker, built devcontainer |
| `task` | Claude Code Task sub-agents | Shared workspace, file ownership | Inside Claude Code session |
| `auto` | Auto-detect best mode | — | — |

**Auto-detection logic**:
1. If `--mode` is explicitly set → use that mode
2. If `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` exists AND Docker is available → `container`
3. If running inside a Claude Code slash command → `task`
4. Otherwise → `subprocess`

#### How Task Mode Works

When running as a slash command (`/zerg:rush`), the orchestrator (Claude Code itself) drives execution through Task tool sub-agents:

1. Collect all tasks at the current level
2. Launch tasks as parallel Task tool calls (one per task)
3. Wait for all to complete
4. Handle failures (retry once per failed task)
5. Run quality gates on the workspace
6. Proceed to next level

Each sub-agent receives a prompt with the task description, file ownership list, acceptance criteria, verification command, and design context.

#### Resume

Resume picks up where you left off:
1. Loads existing state from `.zerg/state/{feature}.json`
2. Identifies incomplete and failed tasks
3. Restores worker assignments
4. Continues from the last checkpoint

---

## Monitoring & Control

---

### /zerg:status

Display real-time execution progress.

**When to use**: While `/zerg:rush` is running, or after execution to see final state.

> **Note**: `/zerg:status` inside Claude Code produces a text snapshot. For live monitoring
> while `/zerg:rush` is running, open a separate terminal: `zerg status --dashboard`

#### Usage

```bash
# Show overall status
/zerg:status

# Watch mode (auto-refresh)
/zerg:status --watch
/zerg:status --watch --interval 2

# Filter to specific level
/zerg:status --level 3

# JSON output for scripting
/zerg:status --json

# Live TUI dashboard (CLI, separate terminal)
zerg status --dashboard
zerg status --dashboard --interval 2
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Short | Description | Default |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--feature TEXT` | `-f` | Feature to show status for | Auto-detected |
| `--watch` | `-w` | Continuous update mode | Off |
| `--interval N` | — | Watch refresh interval in seconds | 5 |
| `--level N` | `-l` | Filter to specific level | All |
| `--json` | — | Output as JSON | Off |

#### Detailed Views

| View | Flag | Shows |
|------|------|-------|
| Default | (none) | Progress bar, worker status, recent activity, blocked tasks |
| Tasks | `--tasks` | All tasks with status, level, and worker assignment |
| Workers | `--workers` | Detailed per-worker info (container, port, branch, current task) |
| Commits | `--commits` | Recent commits per worker branch |

#### Data Sources

Status pulls from multiple sources (Task system is authoritative):
- **Claude Code Tasks** — Primary source for task status
- **State JSON** — Supplementary worker details
- **Docker** — Container status
- **Git** — Commit counts per branch

Status mismatches between Task system and state JSON are flagged with warnings.

#### Worker State Icons

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| 🟢 | Running | Actively executing a task |
| 🟡 | Idle | Waiting for dependencies |
| 🔵 | Verifying | Running verification command |
| 🟠 | Checkpoint | Saving context for restart |

### /zerg:debug

Deep diagnostic investigation for ZERG execution issues. Includes error intelligence, log correlation, Bayesian hypothesis testing, code-aware recovery, and environment diagnostics.

**When to use**: When workers crash, tasks fail, state is corrupt, or you can't figure out what went wrong.

#### Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect and diagnose
/zerg:debug

# Describe the problem
/zerg:debug workers keep crashing

# Focus on specific worker
/zerg:debug --worker 2

# Specific error message
/zerg:debug --error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'"

# Full system diagnostics
/zerg:debug --deep --env

# Generate and execute recovery plan
/zerg:debug --fix

# Write report to file
/zerg:debug --report diag.md
```

#### Flags

| 2. Symptom Classification | Classify into: WORKER_FAILURE, TASK_FAILURE, STATE_CORRUPTION, INFRASTRUCTURE, CODE_ERROR, DEPENDENCY, MERGE_CONFLICT, UNKNOWN |
| 2.5. Log Correlation | Timeline reconstruction, temporal clustering, cross-worker error correlation (Jaccard similarity), error evolution tracking |
| 3. Evidence Collection | Category-specific checklist (worker logs, file existence, state consistency, etc.) |
| 4. Hypothesis Testing | Bayesian probability scoring with prior knowledge base of 30+ failure patterns, automated test commands |
| 5. Root Cause Determination | Synthesize findings into root cause with confidence score |
| 6. Recovery Plan | Code-aware fix suggestions with dependency analysis, git blame context, import chain tracing, fix templates |
| 6.5. Design Escalation Check | Detect if issues require architectural changes → recommend `/zerg:design` |
| 7. Report & Integration | Save markdown report, create tracking task |
| 7.5. Environment Diagnostics | Python venv, packages, Docker, CPU/memory/disk, config validation (when `--env` is set) |

#### Error Categories

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|-----------|
| `WORKER_FAILURE` | Worker crashed, stopped unexpectedly, timeout |
| `TASK_FAILURE` | Task verification failed, code error |

| `CODE_ERROR` | Import error, syntax error, runtime exception |
| `DEPENDENCY` | Missing package, version conflict |
| `MERGE_CONFLICT` | Git merge failure, file ownership violation |

#### Recovery Plan Risk Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[SAFE]` | Read-only or easily reversible |
| `[MODERATE]` | Writes data but can be undone |
| `[DESTRUCTIVE]` | Cannot be undone, requires explicit confirmation |

---

### /zerg:worker

Internal zergling execution protocol. You do not invoke this directly — the orchestrator uses it to give workers their execution instructions.

**When to use**: Automatically invoked by the orchestrator for each worker.

#### What Workers Do

1. **Load context** — Read requirements.md, design.md, task-graph.json, worker-assignments.json
2. **Claim task** — Atomically claim the next pending task at the current level via TaskUpdate
3. **Implement** — Create/modify files as specified, following design patterns
4. **Verify** — Run the task's verification command
5. **Commit** — Stage owned files, commit with task metadata
6. **Report** — Update task status in Claude Task system
7. **Repeat** — Pick next task, or wait for level merge, or checkpoint

#### Quality Standards

Every task must:
- Follow the design document exactly
- Match existing code patterns
- Be complete (no TODOs, no placeholders)
- Pass the verification command
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Handle errors (not just the happy path)

#### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All assigned tasks completed successfully |
| 1 | Unrecoverable error |
| 2 | Context limit reached (70%), needs restart |
| 3 | All remaining tasks blocked |
| 130 | Stop signal received, graceful shutdown |

---

|------|---------|---------|
| `QualityGatePlugin` | Custom validation after merges | SonarQube scan, security scan |
| `LifecycleHookPlugin` | React to events (non-blocking) | Slack notifications, metrics |
| `LauncherPlugin` | Custom worker execution environments | Kubernetes, SSH clusters |

#### Configuration Methods

| Method | Complexity | How |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| YAML hooks | Simple | Shell commands in `.zerg/config.yaml` |
| YAML gates | Simple | Shell commands in `.zerg/config.yaml` |
| Python entry points | Advanced | Python classes registered via `pyproject.toml` |

/zerg:document zerg/launcher.py --output docs/launcher.md --update
```

---

### /zerg:index

Generate a complete documentation wiki for the ZERG project.

**When to use**: To create or update the full project wiki with cross-references and sidebar navigation.

#### Usage

```
/zerg:index [OPTIONS]
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--full` | off | Regenerate all pages from scratch (vs incremental) |

/zerg:estimate [<feature>] [OPTIONS]
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `<feature>` | auto-detect | Feature to estimate (from `.gsd/.current-feature`) |
| `--pre` | auto | Force pre-execution estimation mode |

- **Post-execution**: Compares actual vs estimated duration/tokens/cost, calculates accuracy percentage
- **Calibration**: Analyzes historical accuracy across features, computes per-task-type bias factors

#### Examples

```bash
# Estimate before launching
/zerg:estimate user-auth

# Compare actual vs estimated
/zerg:estimate user-auth --post

# Per-task breakdown
/zerg:estimate --verbose

4. **Design Decisions** — Architectural rationale, trade-offs, alternatives

Auto-detects scope from target format: `file:func` → function, file path → file, directory → module.

#### Examples

```bash
# Explain a file
/zerg:explain zerg/launcher.py

# Explain a specific function
/zerg:explain zerg/launcher.py:spawn_worker
