# COV-018: Test Orchestrator error recovery paths

## Overview
Create tests for recoverable error handling, pause/resume with errors in tests/unit/test_orchestrator_recovery.py.

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_recovery.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `mahabharatha/orchestrator.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_orchestrator_recovery.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test _set_recoverable_error sets pause state
- [ ] Test _set_recoverable_error sets error message
- [ ] Test resume from recoverable error
- [ ] Test worker respawn after crash
- [ ] Test worktree cleanup on recovery
