title: 100% Test Coverage Achievement
description: >
  Achieve 100% test coverage for all core MAHABHARATHA modules including
  orchestrator, launcher, state, worker_protocol, merge, and git_ops.

status: pending
priority: high

current_coverage:
  config.py: 100
  git_ops.py: 100
  containers.py: 100
  worktree.py: 100
  task_sync.py: 100
  worker_protocol.py: 99
  metrics.py: 99
  parser.py: 98
  launcher.py: 93
  orchestrator.py: 91
  state.py: 87
  merge.py: 32

target_coverage: 100

approach:
  - Create comprehensive test mocks for merge, state, and orchestrator
  - Add unit tests for all uncovered lines in merge.py (32% → 100%)
  - Add unit tests for state.py edge cases (87% → 100%)
  - Add unit tests for launcher.py error paths (93% → 100%)
  - Add unit tests for orchestrator.py recovery paths (91% → 100%)
  - Create integration tests verifying module interactions
  - Run full coverage verification
