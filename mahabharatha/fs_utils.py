"""Single-pass filesystem traversal utilities for MAHABHARATHA.

Provides a shared ``collect_files()`` function that walks a directory tree
exactly once via ``rglob('*')`` and returns files grouped by extension.
This replaces scattered per-module rglob calls (repo_map, stack_detector,
etc.) with a single efficient traversal.

    Walks *root* exactly once and buckets every regular file by its
    lowercased suffix.  Directories whose name appears in *exclude_dirs*
    (or starts with ``"."``) are skipped entirely.

    Args:
        root: Root directory to traverse.
        extensions: If provided, only collect files with these extensions
            (e.g. ``{".py", ".js"}``).  Extensions must include the
            leading dot and are compared case-insensitively.
        exclude_dirs: Directory names to skip during traversal.
        names: If provided, files whose name contains any of these
            strings are collected into a ``"_by_name"`` bucket regardless
            of extension (e.g. ``{"Dockerfile"}``).

    Returns:
        Dict mapping extension (e.g. ``".py"``) to a **sorted** list of
        :class:`~pathlib.Path` objects.  When *names* is provided, matched
        files also appear under the ``"_by_name"`` key.
