# Feature Requirements: phase-1-community-governance

## Metadata
- **Feature**: phase-1-community-governance
- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Created**: 2026-02-07T16:20:00
- **Author**: Factory Plan Mode
- **Parent Epic**: #179 (MAHABHARATHA Public Release)
- **Issues**: #185, #186, #187, #188

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Background
MAHABHARATHA is preparing for public release as `mahabharatha-ai` on PyPI. Phase 0 (blockers) is complete — distribution renamed, CHANGELOG frozen, TestPyPI validated, GitHub environments and branch protection configured. The repo is currently private.

### 1.2 Problem
The repo lacks standard open-source community infrastructure: issue templates, PR template, Code of Conduct, Dependabot config, README badges, and GitHub topics. Without these, contributors see an incomplete project and have no structured way to report bugs or submit PRs.

### 1.3 Impact
Without Phase 1:
- Bug reports lack reproducibility info (no template)
- PRs have inconsistent descriptions (no template)
- No Code of Conduct signals unclear community standards
- No badges means no at-a-glance project health
- No topics means poor GitHub discoverability
- No Dependabot means dependency vulnerabilities go unnoticed

---

## 2. Users

### 2.1 Primary Users
- Open-source contributors who want to file issues or submit PRs
- Developers evaluating MAHABHARATHA from the GitHub repo page

### 2.2 Secondary Users
- Maintainer (rocklambros) — benefits from structured issue reports and consistent PRs

### 2.3 User Stories
- As a contributor, I want issue templates so that I provide the right information in bug reports
- As a contributor, I want a PR template so that I know what to include in my pull requests
- As a visitor, I want README badges so that I can assess project health at a glance
- As a maintainer, I want Dependabot so that I'm alerted to vulnerable dependencies

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core Capabilities

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Issue | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| FR-001 | Bug report issue template (YAML form) | Must | #185 | Fields: description, repro steps, expected/actual, environment, logs |
| FR-002 | Feature request issue template (YAML form) | Must | #185 | Fields: problem statement, proposed solution, alternatives, context |
| FR-003 | Issue template config.yml | Must | #185 | Disable blank issues, link to Discussions for questions, link to SECURITY.md |
| FR-004 | Pull request template | Must | #186 | Sections: Summary, Changes, Test Plan, Checklist |
| FR-005 | CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | Must | #186 | Contributor Covenant v2.1 |
| FR-006 | Dependabot config | Must | #187 | pip ecosystem, weekly schedule |
| FR-007 | Enable secret scanning | Must | #187 | Via GitHub API |
| FR-008 | Enable push protection | Should | #187 | Via GitHub API |
| FR-009 | README badges | Must | #188 | PyPI version, Python version, License, CI status |
| FR-010 | GitHub topics | Must | #188 | claude-code, parallel-execution, ai-coding, etc. |
| FR-011 | License compatibility audit | Should | #188 | Verify all deps are MIT/BSD/Apache compatible |
| FR-012 | Update SECURITY.md supported versions | Must | — | Add 0.2.x, reflect current state |

### 3.2 Inputs
- Issue template YAML specs
- Contributor Covenant v2.1 text
- Dependabot config YAML
- Badge markdown from shields.io

### 3.3 Outputs
- 6 new files: 3 issue templates, 1 PR template, 1 CoC, 1 Dependabot config
- 2 modified files: README.md (badges), SECURITY.md (versions)
- GitHub API changes: topics, secret scanning, push protection

### 3.4 Business Rules
- Issue templates use YAML format (renders as forms in GitHub UI)
- Bug report requires: description, repro steps, MAHABHARATHA version
- Feature request requires: problem statement, proposed solution
- PR template checklist references existing CI requirements
- CoC enforcement contact: use GitHub Security Advisories (no personal email)

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
N/A — configuration files only, no runtime impact

### 4.2 Security
- Secret scanning enabled to catch leaked API keys
- Push protection enabled to block commits containing secrets
- Dependabot alerts for dependency vulnerabilities

### 4.3 Reliability
N/A — static files

### 4.4 Scalability
N/A — static files

---

## 5. Scope

### 5.1 In Scope
- GitHub issue templates (bug, feature, config)
- PR template
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- Dependabot configuration
- Secret scanning + push protection enablement
- README badges (PyPI, Python, License, CI)
- GitHub repository topics
- License compatibility audit
- SECURITY.md version table update

### 5.2 Out of Scope
- CodeQL workflow (deferred to Phase 2, #189)
- mypy in CI (deferred to Phase 2, #189)
- mkdocs documentation site (deferred to Phase 2, #190)
- GitHub Discussions setup (already enabled)
- Terminal demo / social preview (deferred to Phase 3, #191)
- Making repo public (separate decision, not part of this spec)

### 5.3 Assumptions
- Repo stays private during Phase 1 (go-public is a separate step)
- Badges will show "not found" until repo is public — that's fine
- Dependabot alerts are already enabled (confirmed via API)
- Branch protection is already configured from Phase 0

### 5.4 Constraints
- Must use Contributor Covenant v2.1 (standard, widely recognized)
- Issue templates must use YAML format (not markdown) for form rendering
- All changes must pass existing CI (quality, smoke, test, audit)

| CONTRIBUTING.md | Reference | Exists |
| SECURITY.md | Reference | Exists (needs version update) |

### 6.2 External Dependencies
| Dependency | Type | Owner |

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### 7.1 Definition of Done
