# COV-007: Test execute_merge with branches and conflicts

## Overview
Create tests for merging multiple branches, handling MergeConflict exceptions, result generation in tests/unit/test_merge_execute.py.

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/test_merge_execute.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `zerg/merge.py`
- `zerg/exceptions.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_merge_execute.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test successful merge of single branch
- [ ] Test successful merge of multiple branches
- [ ] Test merge with MergeConflict exception handling
- [ ] Test MergeResult status values (MERGED, CONFLICT)
- [ ] Test conflicting_files population on conflict
