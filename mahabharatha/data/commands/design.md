Generate technical architecture and prepare for parallel execution.

## Pre-Flight

```bash
FEATURE=${Mahabharatha_FEATURE:-$(cat .gsd/.current-feature 2>/dev/null)}
TASK_LIST=${CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID:-$FEATURE}

if [ -z "$FEATURE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: No active feature. Run /mahabharatha:plan first"
  exit 1
fi

SPEC_DIR=".gsd/specs/$FEATURE"

if [ ! -f "$SPEC_DIR/requirements.md" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Requirements not found. Run /mahabharatha:plan first"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for approval marker
if ! grep -q "Status.*APPROVED" "$SPEC_DIR/requirements.md" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "WARNING: Requirements not marked as APPROVED"
  echo "Continue anyway? (design may need revision)"
fi
```

## Load Context

Read thoroughly:
1. `.gsd/specs/$FEATURE/requirements.md`
2. `.gsd/INFRASTRUCTURE.md`
3. `.gsd/PROJECT.md`
4. Key source files related to the feature

## Phase 1: Architecture Design

Generate high-level architecture:

### 1.1 Component Analysis

For each functional requirement, identify:
- What components are needed?
- What are the responsibilities of each?
- How do they interact?

### 1.2 Data Flow

Map how data moves through the system:
- Entry points (APIs, events, UI)
- Processing stages
- Storage points
- Exit points

### 1.3 Interface Design

Define contracts between components:
- API endpoints and payloads
- Function signatures
- Event schemas
- Database schemas

### 1.4 Key Decisions

Document architectural decisions with rationale:

```markdown
### Decision: {title}

**Context**: {situation and problem}

**Options Considered**:
1. {option 1}: {pros/cons}
2. {option 2}: {pros/cons}
3. {option 3}: {pros/cons}

**Decision**: {chosen option}

**Rationale**: {why this option}

**Consequences**: {what this means for implementation}
```

## Phase 2: Implementation Plan

Break down into phases that enable parallel execution:

### Phase Structure

```markdown
## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Level 1)
Tasks with no dependencies. Can all run in parallel.
- Types and interfaces
- Schema definitions
- Configuration
- Constants

### Phase 2: Core (Level 2)
Depends on Foundation. Can parallelize within phase.
- Business logic services
- Data access layer
- Utility functions

### Phase 3: Integration (Level 3)
Depends on Core. Wire components together.
- API routes
- Event handlers
- Middleware

### Phase 4: Testing (Level 4)
Depends on Integration.
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests

### Phase 5: Quality (Level 5)
Final polish.
- Documentation
- Type coverage
- CHANGELOG.md update (required — add entries under [Unreleased])
- Lint fixes
```

### Mandatory Documentation Tasks

Every task graph MUST include these documentation tasks. This is non-negotiable.

#### CHANGELOG.md (ALWAYS Required)

Every task graph MUST include a CHANGELOG.md update task in Level 5 (Quality). This task:
- Updates the `[Unreleased]` section with entries for all changes in this feature
- Uses categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed
- Depends on all testing-phase tasks

#### Doc Update Tasks (Conditional)

When a feature changes command/flag functionality, the task graph MUST also include tasks to update:
- `README.md` — if CLI usage examples change
- `docs/commands-quick.md` and `docs/commands-deep.md` — if command flags change
- `.gsd/wiki/Command-Reference.md` — if user-facing commands change
- `.gsd/wiki/Tutorial.md` — if workflows change
- `CLAUDE.md` — if project conventions change

These doc update tasks go in Level 4 or 5 (after implementation/testing, before or alongside quality).

### File Ownership Matrix

Critical for parallel execution: each file is owned by ONE task.

```markdown
## File Ownership

| File | Task | Phase |
|------|------|-------|
| src/auth/types.ts | TASK-001 | foundation |
| src/auth/schema.ts | TASK-002 | foundation |
| src/auth/service.ts | TASK-003 | core |
| src/auth/routes.ts | TASK-004 | integration |
| src/auth/service.test.ts | TASK-005 | testing |
```

### Consumer Matrix

Every task that creates a module must declare who calls its output. Tasks with no consumers are leaf tasks (CLI entry points, test files).

| Task | Creates | Consumed By | Integration Test |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| {task} | {file} | {consumer task IDs or "leaf"} | {test file path or "—"} |

Rules:
- If a task has consumers, it MUST have an `integration_test` field
- If a task is a leaf (no consumers), `integration_test` is optional
- Consumer references must point to real task IDs in the graph

## Phase 2.5: Context Engineering

For each task in the task graph, populate the optional `context` field with scoped context to minimize worker token usage.

### Per-Task Context

For each task entry in task-graph.json, add a `context` key containing:

1. **Relevant spec excerpts** — paragraphs from requirements.md and design.md that relate to this task's title, description, and file paths
2. **Security rules** — filtered by file extensions in the task's create/modify lists:
   - `.py` files → include Python security rules summary
   - `.js`/`.ts` files → include JavaScript security rules summary
   - `Dockerfile` → include Docker security rules summary
   - Always include OWASP core rules summary
3. **Dependency context** — brief summary of what upstream dependencies produce (types, interfaces)

### Budget

Keep each task's `context` field under ~4000 tokens (~16,000 characters). Prioritize:
- Security rules: ~30% of budget
- Spec excerpts: ~50% of budget
- Dependency context: ~20% of budget

### Example

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-003",
  "title": "Implement auth service",
  "context": "## Security Rules (Python)\n- Use parameterized queries...\n\n## Spec Context\nThe auth service must support JWT...\n\n## Dependencies\nTASK-001 creates User TypedDict in types.py..."
}
```

Workers receiving task-scoped context skip loading full spec files, saving ~2000-5000 tokens per task.

## Phase 3: Task Graph Generation

Generate `task-graph.json` for the orchestrator:

```json

## Phase 4.5: Track Design in Claude Task System

At the START of design (before Phase 1), create a tracking task:

Call TaskCreate:
  - subject: "[Design] Architecture for {feature}"
  - description: "Design phase for {feature}. Generating architecture and task graph via /mahabharatha:design."
  - activeForm: "Designing {feature}"

Immediately call TaskUpdate to set it in_progress:
  - taskId: (the Claude Task ID just created)
  - status: "in_progress"

After task registration succeeds (Phase 4.6 below), mark the design task completed:

Call TaskUpdate:
  - taskId: (the design task's Claude Task ID)
  - status: "completed"

## Phase 4.6: Register Tasks in Claude Task System

After generating task-graph.json, create a Claude Task for every task using the TaskCreate tool.

For each task in the task graph:

1. Call TaskCreate:
   - subject: "[L{level}] {title}"
   - description: Include full description, file ownership list, verification command
   - activeForm: "Executing {title}"

2. After ALL tasks are created, set up dependency chains.
   For each task with dependencies, call TaskUpdate:
   - taskId: the Claude Task ID assigned to this task
   - addBlockedBy: list of Claude Task IDs for each dependency

3. Call TaskList to verify all tasks created and dependencies wired correctly.

The backlog markdown is auto-generated by the CLI at tasks/{FEATURE}-BACKLOG.md.

## Phase 5: Validate Task Graph

Check for issues:

```bash
# Verify no circular dependencies
# Verify file ownership is exclusive
# Verify all files exist or are created
# Verify verification commands are valid
# Verify every task with non-empty consumers has an integration_test
# Verify consumer references point to real task IDs
# Verify integration_test files are owned by a task
```

## Phase 6: User Approval
