## Implementation Status

### Fully Implemented

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ARCHITECTURE.md | Comprehensive design documentation |
| Devcontainer config | Dockerfile, docker-compose, scripts |
| MCP server config | Installation script for MCP servers |
| Environment passthrough | Claude API key, config mounting |
| Slash command templates | 6 prompt templates for workflow |
| Project infrastructure | .gsd/PROJECT.md, INFRASTRUCTURE.md |

### Partially Implemented (Templates Only)

| Component | Status | Gap |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Slash commands | Prompts exist | No execution logic |
| Task graph schema | Documented | No validator |
| Worker protocol | Described | No implementation |
| Level synchronization | Described | No execution |
| Quality gates | Stub to echo | No verification |

### Not Implemented

| Component | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| orchestrator.py | Cannot execute any tasks |
| Task graph generation | Cannot create work items |
| Worker assignment | Cannot distribute tasks |
| Git worktree automation | Cannot isolate workers |
| Health monitoring | Cannot detect failures |
| Level merge logic | Cannot combine worker output |
| Status aggregation | Cannot report progress |

## Design Decisions (From ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Preserved Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Git worktrees per worker | Prevents conflicts without file locking |
| Level-based execution | Dependency ordering via waves |
| Exclusive file ownership | Design-time conflict prevention |
| Spec as memory | Stateless workers, restartable |
| Native Tasks integration | Claude Code persistence via shared volume |
| Random port allocation | 49152-65535 range, orchestrator tracks |

### Structure Decisions

| Aspect | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Five levels | foundation → core → integration → testing → quality |
| Context threshold | 70% triggers handoff |
| Verification | verification_command per task |
| Merge gates | Quality check between levels |

## Technical Debt

### Critical

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Missing orchestrator.py | No execution capability |
| No execution code | All templates, no runtime |
| No task graph validator | Invalid graphs accepted |

### Moderate

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Quality gates stub | No actual verification |
| No error recovery | Only basic retry |
| No context detection | Workers don't know project type |
| MCP install failures ignored | Silent failures |

### Minor

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| .DS_Store files | Git clutter |
| Hardcoded paths | Limited portability |
| No .gitignore for worktrees | Worktrees tracked |

## Foundation to Preserve

These design elements align with external best practices and should be preserved:

1. **Spec as memory**: Workers share files not conversation (matches superpowers, SuperClaude)
2. **Exclusive file ownership**: Design-time conflict prevention (unique to MAHABHARATHA)
3. **Level-based execution**: Dependency ordering via waves (unique to MAHABHARATHA)
4. **Git worktrees**: Branch isolation (matches packnplay, superpowers)
5. **Native Tasks integration**: Claude Code persistence (matches ecosystem)
6. **Verification commands**: Task completion criteria (matches superpowers)
7. **70% context threshold**: Handoff trigger (unique to MAHABHARATHA)
8. **Port allocation strategy**: 49152-65535 ephemeral range (standard practice)

## Conclusion

MAHABHARATHA has a well-designed architecture with comprehensive documentation. The critical gap is implementation: no orchestrator runtime exists. The devcontainer infrastructure is working and can be preserved. The slash command templates provide workflow structure but need execution logic.

**Recommendation**: Implement orchestrator.py as the first priority, using patterns from packnplay (worktrees) and superpowers (task execution) while preserving MAHABHARATHA's unique level-based synchronization design.
