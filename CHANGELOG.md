# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Consolidated security engine with 15 capability areas in `zerg/security/` package
- Security integrated as Stage 3 in `/z:review` (Spec → Quality → Security)
- `--no-security` flag for `/z:review` to skip security scanning
- CVE dependency scanning with osv.dev API and heuristic fallback
- `SecurityResult` and `SecurityFinding` structured return types

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- `/z:plan` and `/z:brainstorm` proactively entering Claude Code plan mode — added explicit `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` prohibition to workflow boundary
- Missing Phase 5.5 post-approval handoff in `/z:plan` — restored `AskUserQuestion` with 'Clear context, then /z:design' option

### Changed

- `/z:plan` now accepts `--issue N` or `#N` flag to load a GitHub issue as brainstorm context, reducing redundant Phase 2 questions
- `/z:brainstorm` Phase 4 handoff now includes the top issue number in the suggested `/z:plan` command

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed

- `/z:plan` jumping to implementation instead of stopping — removed `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` tools whose built-in "plan → implement" semantics overrode text-based stop guards
- Same skip-to-implement behavior in `/z:brainstorm` — removed plan mode wrapping, commands now use direct exploration tools
- Stale "Enter Plan Mode" references in `plan.core.md` Phase 0 validation

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- `ZERG_FEATURE` environment variable for terminal-scoped feature isolation in multi-epic workflows
- Advisory lockfile system (`.gsd/specs/{feature}/.lock`) to warn about concurrent sessions on the same feature
- `AskUserQuestion` structured approval gate in `/z:plan` to prevent auto-continuation into design phase
- Feature-scoped git ship action — `/z:git --action ship` now scopes PRs to the active feature's branches
- Comprehensive unit tests for 19 under-covered modules, raising overall coverage from 77% to 83%
- `.github/FUNDING.yml` for GitHub Sponsors (#191)
- `.github/release.yml` for auto-categorized release notes (#191)
- `lychee` link checker CI job for documentation (#191)
- Custom single-page landing site (`docs/index.html`) with dark/light mode toggle, glassmorphism design, and scroll animations (#204)
- 26-command cheat sheet table, pipeline visualization, FAQ accordion, and copy-to-clipboard (#204)
- Optimized web logo (`docs/assets/img/zerg-logo-web.png`, <200KB) and Open Graph social preview image (#204)
- Simplified GitHub Pages deployment — direct `docs/` upload replaces MkDocs build (#205)

### Fixed

- Level-aware task claiming — workers can no longer claim tasks above the current orchestrator level
- All 15 command pre-flights now read `ZERG_FEATURE` env var before `.gsd/.current-feature` file
- TOCTOU race in advisory lockfile acquisition — now uses atomic file creation via `os.open` with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`
- Missing ownership check in lockfile release — now validates PID before deletion
- Unprotected file reads in `detect_feature()` and lockfile functions — now resilient to OS/encoding errors
- Path traversal vulnerability in feature name handling — now validates against directory escape
- Unbounded PID/timestamp parsing in lockfile content — now bounds-checked with safe integer limits

### Changed

- Pre-commit config expanded with 6 standard hooks (`trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `check-yaml`, `check-json`, `check-toml`, `check-added-large-files`) (#191)

### Removed

- MkDocs-based documentation build (`mkdocs.yml`, `docs/index.md`) — replaced by custom landing page (#204)

- `--uc`/`--compact` deprecated (compact is now default behavior)
- `--loop` deprecated (loops are now default behavior)
- Context plugin budget rebalanced: rules 10%, security 10%, spec 25%, MCP 10%, depth 10%, mode 10%, TDD 10%, efficiency 5%, buffer 10%
- `zerg/git_ops.py` converted to backward-compatible shim re-exporting from `zerg/git/ops.py`
- `zerg/commands/git_cmd.py` expanded from 6 to 11 actions with engine delegation
- Context engineering guardrails: automated drift detection and command validation (`python -m zerg.validate_commands`)
- Command template (`_template.md`) for new commands to inherit CE patterns by default
- CI workflow and pre-commit hook for command file validation
- `/zerg:brainstorm` command for open-ended feature discovery with competitive research, Socratic ideation, and automated GitHub issue creation
- 8 new feature issues for open-source release roadmap
- GitHub Actions workflow to enforce CHANGELOG.md updates on PRs (skippable with `skip-changelog` label)
- Claude Code instruction in CLAUDE.md to proactively update changelog when creating PRs
- Updated README, `docs/commands.md`, wiki `Command-git.md`, and `Command-Reference.md` to document all 11 `/zerg:git` actions

### Deprecated

- `--uc`, `--compact` flags (use `--no-compact` to disable instead)
- `--loop` flag (use `--no-loop` to disable instead)

### Fixed

- `zerg status` now distinguishes between planned, in-design, and designed-but-not-executing features instead of a single generic message
- `zerg status` now shows "planned but not yet executed" instead of cryptic error for features with specs but no state
- `zerg cleanup` now clears `.gsd/.current-feature` when it points to a cleaned feature
- `zerg cleanup` now removes orphaned `.gsd/specs/{feature}/` directories
- `zerg rush` now clears `.gsd/.current-feature` on successful completion to prevent stale pointers

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- Parallel Claude Code execution system with orchestrator, workers, and task graphs
- 26 slash commands (`/zerg:brainstorm`, `/zerg:init`, `/zerg:plan`, `/zerg:design`, `/zerg:rush`, `/zerg:status`, `/zerg:merge`, `/zerg:stop`, `/zerg:retry`, `/zerg:cleanup`, `/zerg:worker`, `/zerg:debug`, `/zerg:build`, `/zerg:test`, `/zerg:review`, `/zerg:analyze`, `/zerg:refactor`, `/zerg:security`, `/zerg:git`, `/zerg:logs`, `/zerg:document`, `/zerg:estimate`, `/zerg:explain`, `/zerg:index`, `/zerg:select-tool`, `/zerg:plugins`)
- Shortcut aliases (`/z:*`) for all commands
- Dual execution modes: subprocess and Docker container
- Git worktree-based branch isolation for parallel workers
- Level-based task dependency system with automatic merge between levels
- Two-stage quality gates (per-task verification + per-level merge gates)
- State persistence with atomic writes and crash-safe recovery
- Claude Code Task ecosystem integration for cross-session coordination
- Context engineering plugin with command splitting and task-scoped context
- Doc engine with wiki generation, cross-references, and Mermaid diagrams
- Performance analysis adapters (semgrep, trivy, hadolint, lizard, radon, vulture, jscpd, cloc, deptry, pipdeptree, dive)
- Risk scoring, dry-run simulation, and what-if analysis
- Structured logging with per-worker JSONL output and log correlation
- Plugin system with lifecycle hooks and custom quality gates
- Security rules auto-fetched from OWASP 2025 and language-specific rulesets
- 5,953 tests at 97% coverage

### Fixed

- Reject unknown launcher modes instead of silent fallback to subprocess
- Show human-friendly launcher mode and worker count in rush output
- Audit skipped tests and convert unconditional skips to conditional skipif decorators
