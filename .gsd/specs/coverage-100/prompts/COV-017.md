# COV-017: Test Orchestrator merge timeout handling

## Overview
Create tests for merge timeout with ThreadPoolExecutor, retry logic in tests/unit/test_orchestrator_timeout.py.

## Files to Create
- `tests/unit/test_orchestrator_timeout.py`

## Files to Modify
None

## Files to Read
- `zerg/orchestrator.py`

## Requirements

Implement the task as described. Follow TDD approach:
1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor if needed

## Verification

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_orchestrator_timeout.py -v --tb=short
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test merge timeout triggers retry
- [ ] Test exponential backoff between retries
- [ ] Test max retries reached pauses orchestrator
- [ ] Test successful merge after retry
- [ ] Test timeout configuration from config
