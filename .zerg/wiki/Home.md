# ZERG Wiki

**Parallel Claude Code execution system.** Overwhelm features with coordinated zergling instances.

ZERG coordinates multiple Claude Code sessions to build features in parallel. You describe what to build, ZERG breaks the work into atomic tasks with exclusive file ownership, and multiple workers execute those tasks simultaneously -- organized by dependency levels so nothing conflicts.

## How ZERG Works

The workflow has four stages. Each stage requires explicit user approval before proceeding to the next.

```
Plan  -->  Design  -->  Rush  -->  Merge
 |           |           |          |
 v           v           v          v
Capture    Generate    Launch     Merge
requirements  task      parallel   branches,
and specs    graph     workers    run quality
             with file            gates
             ownership
```

**Plan.** You describe what to build. ZERG captures requirements through structured questions and writes them to a spec file.

**Design.** ZERG generates a technical architecture and breaks the work into a task graph. Each task owns specific files -- no two tasks touch the same file.

**Rush.** Multiple Claude Code instances (workers) execute tasks in parallel. Workers within the same dependency level run simultaneously. After all workers at a level finish, ZERG merges their branches before the next level begins.

**Merge.** The orchestrator merges worker branches after each level, runs quality gates (lint, typecheck, tests), and advances to the next level.

## Key Commands

```
/zerg:init               Initialize ZERG for a project
/zerg:plan <feature>     Capture requirements for a feature
/zerg:design             Generate architecture and task graph
/zerg:rush --workers=5   Launch parallel workers
/zerg:status             Check execution progress
/zerg:merge              Manually trigger a level merge
/zerg:stop               Stop all workers
/zerg:retry <task-id>    Retry a failed task
```

See the Command Reference page for the full list of 25 commands.
