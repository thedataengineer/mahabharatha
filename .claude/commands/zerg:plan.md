# ZERG Plan: $ARGUMENTS

Capture complete requirements for feature: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Flags

- `--socratic` or `-s`: Use structured 3-round discovery mode
- `--rounds N`: Number of rounds (default: 3, max: 5)

## Pre-Flight

```bash
FEATURE="$ARGUMENTS"

# Validate feature name
if [ -z "$FEATURE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Feature name required"
  echo "Usage: /zerg:plan feature-name"
  exit 1
fi

# Sanitize feature name (lowercase, hyphens only)
FEATURE=$(echo "$FEATURE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-' | tr -cd 'a-z0-9-')

# Create spec directory
mkdir -p ".gsd/specs/$FEATURE"
echo "$FEATURE" > .gsd/.current-feature
echo "$(date -Iseconds)" > ".gsd/specs/$FEATURE/.started"
```

## Enter Plan Mode

**Press Shift+Tab twice** to enter plan mode (Opus 4.5 for reasoning).

Plan mode gives you read-only tools to explore the codebase without making changes.

---

## Socratic Mode (--socratic)

If `--socratic` flag is used, follow this structured 3-round discovery process:

### Round 1: Problem Space (5 questions max)

Focus on understanding the problem before jumping to solutions.

```
ROUND 1: PROBLEM SPACE
══════════════════════

1. What specific problem does this feature solve?
   (Describe the pain point or gap)

2. Who are the primary users affected by this problem?
   (Be specific about user roles/personas)

3. What happens today without this feature?
   (Current workarounds, manual processes, or blocked workflows)

4. Why is solving this problem important now?
   (Business impact, urgency, opportunity cost)

5. How will we know when the problem is solved?
   (Observable changes, success indicators)
```

Wait for user responses before proceeding.

### Round 2: Solution Space (5 questions max)

Explore solution boundaries and constraints.

```
ROUND 2: SOLUTION SPACE
═══════════════════════

1. What does the ideal solution look like?
   (Describe the vision without constraints)

2. What constraints must we work within?
   (Technical, time, budget, compatibility)

3. What are the non-negotiable requirements?
   (Must-haves vs nice-to-haves)

4. What similar solutions exist? What can we learn from them?
   (Prior art, competitors, analogies)

5. What should this solution explicitly NOT do?
   (Scope boundaries, anti-patterns)
```

Wait for user responses before proceeding.

### Round 3: Implementation Space (5 questions max)

Get concrete about execution.

```
ROUND 3: IMPLEMENTATION SPACE
═════════════════════════════

1. What is the minimum viable version of this feature?
   (First releasable increment)

2. What can be deferred to future iterations?
   (Nice-to-haves, enhancements)

3. What are the biggest technical risks?
   (Unknowns, dependencies, complexity)

4. How should we verify this works correctly?
   (Test scenarios, acceptance criteria)

5. What documentation or training is needed?
   (User guides, API docs, runbooks)
```

After completing all rounds, synthesize into requirements.md.

### Socratic Mode Output

After completing the rounds, generate a transcript section:

```markdown

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

Before asking questions, understand the current state:

1. **Read PROJECT.md and INFRASTRUCTURE.md**
   - Understand existing tech stack
   - Know what's already available

2. **Explore Codebase**
   - List directory structure
   - Read key files (package.json, existing similar features)
   - Identify patterns in use

3. **Search for Similar Patterns**
   - How are existing features structured?
   - What conventions are in place?
   - What's the testing strategy?

## Phase 2: Requirements Elicitation

Ask clarifying questions. Group them logically. Don't ask everything at once.

**Question Categories:**

### Problem Space
- What problem does this feature solve?
- Who are the users of this feature?
- What happens if this feature doesn't exist?

### Functional Requirements
- What are the core capabilities?
- What inputs does the feature accept?
- What outputs does the feature produce?
- What are the edge cases?

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements (latency, throughput)?
- Security requirements (authentication, authorization)?
- Scalability requirements?
- Reliability requirements?

### Scope Boundaries
- What is explicitly OUT of scope?
- What are acceptable compromises?
- What can be deferred to future iterations?

### Dependencies
- Does this depend on other features?
- Are there external API dependencies?
- Are there data dependencies?

### Acceptance Criteria
- How will we know this feature is complete?
- What are the test scenarios?
- What does success look like?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                 REQUIREMENTS READY FOR REVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Feature: {feature}

Summary:
  • {N} functional requirements ({must}/{should}/{could})
  • {N} non-functional requirements
  • {N} test scenarios
  • {N} open questions

Files Created:
  • .gsd/specs/{feature}/requirements.md

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Please review the requirements document.

Reply with:
  • "APPROVED" - to proceed to design phase
  • "REJECTED" - describe what needs to change
  • Specific questions or concerns

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Track in Claude Task System

After user approves requirements, call TaskCreate:
  - subject: "[Plan] Requirements: {feature}"
  - description: "Requirements captured and approved for {feature}. Ready for /zerg:design."
  - activeForm: "Planning {feature}"

Then call TaskUpdate to mark it completed:
  - taskId: (the Claude Task ID)
  - status: "completed"

This creates a visible record in the task system that planning is done.

## Status Markers

Use these markers in requirements.md to track status:

- **Status: DRAFT** - Initial creation, still gathering requirements
- **Status: REVIEW** - Requirements complete, awaiting approval
- **Status: APPROVED** - Requirements approved, ready for design
- **Status: REJECTED** - Requirements need revision

## Completion Criteria

- requirements.md exists with Status: APPROVED
- All open questions resolved or accepted
- User has explicitly approved with "APPROVED"
